Code block name: ATOPlexDNA_First round of magnetic bead purification

Description: Perform the first round of magnetic bead purification experiment

Required solutions:

(1)PCR_1st: The solution obtained after the first round of PCR.

(2)DNA_Clean_Beads: Magnetic bead solution, used to adsorb DNA fragments, 25μL is required for each sample.

(3)80%_Ethanol: Used to wash the magnetic beads, which needs to be washed twice, 160μL is required for each sample.

(4)TE_buffer: Used to dissolve the DNA adsorbed in the magnetic beads, 6.5μL is required for each sample.

Layout:

(1) Place the 20μL tip rack in slot 10, and the 300μL tip rack in slots 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

(2) Place the magnetic module in slot 1 and place a 200μL Bio-Rad 96-well PCR plate on the magnetic module.
(3) Place a USA Scientific 12-well 22 ml reservoir plate in slot 2.
(4) Use a P20 multichannel pipette, mounted on the left, and use the tip rack in slot 10.
(5) Use a P300 multichannel pipette, mounted on the right, and use the tip racks in slots 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

Liquid loading:
(1) Place the PCR_1st solution in the PCR well plate of the magnetic module No. 1, and place them in columns, with the number of wells equal to the number of samples.
(2) Place the DNA_Clean_Beads solution in column A1 of the reservoir plate in slot 2.
(3) Place the TE_buffer solution in column A2 of the reservoir plate in slot 2.
(4) Divide the 80%_Ethanol solution into two equal portions and place them in columns A3 and A4 of the reservoir plate in slot 2.
