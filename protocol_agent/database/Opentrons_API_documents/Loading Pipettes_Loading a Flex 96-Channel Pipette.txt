This code sample loads the Flex 96-Channel Pipette. Because of its size, the Flex 96-Channel Pipette requires the left *and* right pipette mounts. You cannot use this pipette with 1- or 8-Channel Pipette in the same protocol or when these instruments are attached to the robot. Load the 96-channel pipette as follows:

```
def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    pipette = protocol.load_instrument(
        instrument_name='flex_96channel_1000'
    )
```

In protocols specifying API version 2.15, also include `mount='left'` as a parameter of `load_instrument()`.

*New in version 2.15.*

*Changed in version 2.16:* The `mount` parameter is optional.
