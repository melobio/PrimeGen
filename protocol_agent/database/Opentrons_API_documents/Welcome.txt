The Opentrons Python Protocol API is a Python framework designed to make it easy to write automated biology lab protocols. Python protocols can control Opentrons Flex and OT-2 robots, their pipettes, and optional hardware modules. We’ve designed the API to be accessible to anyone with basic Python and wet-lab skills.

As a bench scientist, you should be able to code your protocols in a way that reads like a lab notebook. You can write a fully functional protocol just by listing the equipment you’ll use (modules, labware, and pipettes) and the exact sequence of movements the robot should make.

As a programmer, you can leverage the full power of Python for advanced automation in your protocols. Perform calculations, manage external data, use built-in and imported Python modules, and more to implement your custom lab workflow.
