Introduced with [robot software version](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/versioning.html#version-table) 3.19, the safety switch feature prevents the OT-2, and your protocol, from running if the door is open. To operate properly, the front door and top window of your OT-2 must be closed. You can toggle the door safety switch on or off from **Robot Settings > Advanced > Usage Settings**.

To check if the robot’s door is closed at a specific point during a protocol run, call [`ProtocolContext.door_closed`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.ProtocolContext.door_closed). It returns a Boolean `True` (door closed) or `False` (door open) response.

```python
protocol.door_closed
```

> Warning:
>
> [`door_closed`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.ProtocolContext.door_closed) is a status check only. It does not control the robot’s behavior. If you wish to implement a custom method to pause or resume a protocol using `door_closed`, disable the door safety feature first (not recommended).

*New in version 2.5.*
