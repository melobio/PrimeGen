To blow an extra amount of air through the pipette’s tip, call the [`InstrumentContext.blow_out()`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.InstrumentContext.blow_out) method. You can use a specific well in a well plate or reservoir as the blowout location. If no location is specified, the pipette will blowout from its current well position:

```python
pipette.blow_out()
```

You can also specify a particular well as the blowout location:

```python
pipette.blow_out(plate['B1'])
```

Many protocols use a trash container for blowing out the pipette. You can specify the pipette’s current trash container as the blowout location by using the [`InstrumentContext.trash_container`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.InstrumentContext.trash_container) property:

```python
pipette.blow_out(pipette.trash_container)
```

*New in version 2.0.*

*Changed in version 2.16:* Added support for `TrashBin` and `WasteChute` locations.
