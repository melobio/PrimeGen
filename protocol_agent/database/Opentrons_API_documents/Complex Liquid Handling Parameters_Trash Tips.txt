The `trash` parameter controls what the pipette does with tips at the end of complex commands. When `True`, the pipette drops tips into the trash. When `False`, the pipette returns tips to their original locations in their tip rack.

The default is `True`, so you only have to set `trash` when you want the tip-returning behavior:

```python
pipette.transfer(
    volume=100,
    source=plate["A1"],
    dest=plate["B1"],
    trash=False,
)
```
