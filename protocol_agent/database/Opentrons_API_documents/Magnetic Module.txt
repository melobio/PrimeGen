> Note:

> The Magnetic Module is compatible with the OT-2 only. If you have a Flex, use the [Magnetic Block](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/modules/magnetic_block.html#magnetic-block).

The Magnetic Module controls a set of permanent magnets which can move vertically to induce a magnetic field in the labware loaded on the module.

The Magnetic Module is represented by a [`MagneticModuleContext`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.MagneticModuleContext) object, which has methods for engaging (raising) and disengaging (lowering) its magnets.

The examples in this section apply to an OT-2 with a Magnetic Module GEN2 loaded in slot 6:

```python
def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    mag_mod = protocol.load_module(
      module_name='magnetic module gen2',
      location='6')
    plate = mag_mod.load_labware(
      name='nest_96_wellplate_100ul_pcr_full_skirt')
```

*New in version 2.3.*
