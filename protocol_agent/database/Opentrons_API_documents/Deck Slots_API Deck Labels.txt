The API accepts values that correspond to the physical deck slot labels on a Flex or OT-2 robot. Specify a slot in either format:

- A coordinate like `"A1"`. This format must be a string.
- A number like `"10"` or `10`. This format can be a string or an integer.

As of API version 2.15, the Flex and OT-2 formats are interchangeable. You can use either format, regardless of which robot your protocol is for. You could even mix and match formats within a protocol, although this is not recommended.

For example, these two `load_labware()` commands are equivalent:

```python
protocol.load_labware("nest_96_wellplate_200ul_flat", "A1")
```

*New in version 2.15.*

```python
protocol.load_labware("nest_96_wellplate_200ul_flat", 10)
```

*New in version 2.0.*

Both of these commands would require you to load the well plate in the back left slot of the robot.

The correspondence between deck labels is based on the relative locations of the slots. The full list of slot equivalencies is as follows:

| Flex | A1   | A2   | A3    | B1   | B2   | B3   | C1   | C2   | C3   | D1   | D2   | D3   |
| :--- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| OT-2 | 10   | 11   | Trash | 7    | 8    | 9    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 1    | 2    | 3    |

Slots A4, B4, C4, and D4 on Flex have no equivalent on OT-2.
