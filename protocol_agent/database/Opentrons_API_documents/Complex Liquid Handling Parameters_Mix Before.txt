The `mix_before` parameter controls mixing in source wells before each aspiration. Its value must be a [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple) with two numeric values. The first value is the number of repetitions, and the second value is the amount of liquid to mix in µL.

For example, this transfer command will mix 50 µL of liquid 3 times before each of its aspirations:

```python
pipette.transfer(
    volume=100,
    source=plate["A1"],
    dest=[plate["B1"], plate["B2"]],
    mix_before=(3, 50),
)
```

*New in version 2.0.*

Mixing occurs before every aspiration, including when [tip refilling](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/complex_commands/order_operations.html#complex-tip-refilling) is required.

> Note:
>
> [`consolidate()`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.InstrumentContext.consolidate) ignores any value of `mix_before`. Mixing on the second and subsequent aspirations of a consolidate command would defeat its purpose: to aspirate multiple times in a row, from different wells, *before* dispensing.
