To add and remove labware from the Heater-Shaker, control the module’s labware latch from your protocol using [`open_labware_latch()`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.HeaterShakerContext.open_labware_latch) and [`close_labware_latch()`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.HeaterShakerContext.close_labware_latch). Shaking requires the labware latch to be closed, so you may want to issue a close command before the first shake command in your protocol:

```python
hs_mod.close_labware_latch()
hs_mod.set_and_wait_for_shake_speed(500)
```

If the labware latch is already closed, `close_labware_latch()` will succeed immediately; you don’t have to check the status of the latch before opening or closing it.

To prepare the deck before running a protocol, use the labware latch controls in the Opentrons App or run these methods in Jupyter notebook.
