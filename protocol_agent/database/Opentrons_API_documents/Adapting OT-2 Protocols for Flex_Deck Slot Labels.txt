Itâ€™s good practice to update numeric labels for [deck slots](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/deck_slots.html#deck-slots) (which match the labels on an OT-2) to coordinate ones (which match the labels on Flex). This is an optional step, since the two formats are interchangeable.

For example, the code in the previous section changed the location of the tip rack from `1` to `"D1"`.
