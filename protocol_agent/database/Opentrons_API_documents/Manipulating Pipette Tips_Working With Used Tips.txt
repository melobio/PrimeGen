Currently, the API considers tips as “used” after being picked up. For example, if the robot picked up a tip from rack location A1 and then returned it to the same location, it will not attempt to pick up this tip again, unless explicitly specified. Instead, the robot will pick up a tip starting from rack location B1. For example:

```python
pipette.pick_up_tip()                # picks up tip from rack location A1
pipette.return_tip()                 # drops tip in rack location A1
pipette.pick_up_tip()                # picks up tip from rack location B1
pipette.drop_tip()                   # drops tip in trash bin
pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack_1['A1']) # picks up tip from rack location A1
```

Early API versions treated returned tips as unused items. They could be picked up again without an explicit argument. For example:

```python
pipette.pick_up_tip()  # picks up tip from rack location A1
pipette.return_tip()   # drops tip in rack location A1
pipette.pick_up_tip()  # picks up tip from rack location A1
```
