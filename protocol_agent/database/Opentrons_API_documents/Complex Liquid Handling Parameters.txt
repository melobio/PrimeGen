Complex commands accept a number of optional parameters that give you greater control over the exact steps they perform.

This page describes the accepted values and behavior of each parameter. The parameters are organized in the order that they first add a step. Some parameters, such as `touch_tip`, add multiple steps. See [Order of Operations](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/complex_commands/order_operations.html#complex-command-order) for more details on the sequence of steps performed by complex commands.

The API reference entry for [`InstrumentContext.transfer()`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.InstrumentContext.transfer) also lists the parameters and has more information on their implementation as keyword arguments.
