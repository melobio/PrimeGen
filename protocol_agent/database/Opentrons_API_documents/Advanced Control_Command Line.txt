The robot’s command line is accessible either by going to **New > Terminal** in Jupyter or [via SSH](https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Connecting-to-your-OT-2-with-SSH).

To execute a protocol from the robot’s command line, copy the protocol file to the robot with `scp` and then run the protocol with `opentrons_execute`:

```python
$ opentrons_execute /data/my_protocol.py
```

By default, `opentrons_execute` will print out the same run log shown in the Opentrons App, as the protocol executes. It also prints out internal logs at the level `warning` or above. Both of these behaviors can be changed. Run `opentrons_execute --help` for more information.
