Building block commands execute some of the most basic actions that your robot can complete. But basic doesn’t mean these commands lack capabilities. They perform important tasks in your protocols. They’re also foundational to the [complex commands](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_complex_commands.html#v2-complex-commands) that help you combine multiple actions into fewer lines of code.

Pages in this section of the documentation cover:

- [Manipulating Pipette Tips](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/basic_commands/pipette_tips.html#pipette-tips): Get started with commands for picking up pipette tips, dropping tips, returning tips, and working with used tips.
- [Liquid Control](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/basic_commands/liquids.html#liquid-control): Learn about aspirating and dispensing liquids, blow out and touch tip procedures, mixing, and creating air gaps.
- [Utility Commands](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/basic_commands/utilities.html#new-utility-commands): Control various robot functions such as pausing or delaying a protocol, checking the robot’s door, turning robot lights on/off, and more.
