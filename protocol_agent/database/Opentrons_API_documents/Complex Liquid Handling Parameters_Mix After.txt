The `mix_after` parameter controls mixing in source wells after each dispense. Its value must be a [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple) with two numeric values. The first value is the number of repetitions, and the second value is the amount of liquid to mix in µL.

For example, this transfer command will mix 50 µL of liquid 3 times after each of its dispenses:

```python
pipette.transfer(
    volume=100,
    source=plate["A1"],
    dest=[plate["B1"], plate["B2"]],
    mix_after=(3, 50),
)
```

*New in version 2.0.*

> Note:
>
> [`distribute()`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.InstrumentContext.distribute) ignores any value of `mix_after`. Mixing after dispensing would combine (and potentially contaminate) the remaining source liquid with liquid present at the destination.
