The `air_gap` parameter controls how much air to aspirate and hold in the bottom of the tip when it contains liquid. The parameter’s value is the amount of air to aspirate in µL.

Air-gapping behavior is different for each complex command. The different behaviors all serve the same purpose, which is to never leave the pipette holding liquid at the very bottom of the tip. This helps keep liquids from seeping out of the pipette.

| Method          | Air-gapping behavior                                         |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transfer()`    | Air gap after each aspiration.Pipette is empty after dispensing. |
| `distribute()`  | Air gap after each aspiration.Air gap after dispensing if the pipette isn’t empty. |
| `consolidate()` | Air gap after each aspiration. This may create multiple air gaps within the tip.Pipette is empty after dispensing. |

For example, this transfer command will create a 20 µL air gap after each of its aspirations. When dispensing, it will clear the air gap and dispense the full 100 µL of liquid:

```python
pipette.transfer(
    volume=100,
    source=plate["A1"],
    dest=plate["B1"],
    air_gap=20,
)
```

*New in version 2.0.*

When consolidating, air gaps still occur after every aspiration. In this example, the tip will use 210 µL of its capacity (50 µL of liquid followed by 20 µL of air, repeated three times):

```python
pipette.consolidate(
    volume=50,
    source=[plate["A1"], plate["A2"], plate["A3"]],
    dest=plate["B1"],
    air_gap=20,
)

If adding an air gap would exceed the pipette’s maximum volume, the complex command will use a [tip refilling strategy](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/complex_commands/order_operations.html#complex-tip-refilling). For example, this command uses a 300 µL pipette to transfer 300 µL of liquid plus an air gap:

```python
pipette.transfer(
    volume=300,
    source=plate["A1"],
    dest=plate["B1"],
    air_gap=20,
)
```

As a result, the transfer is split into two aspirates of 150 µL, each with their own 20 µL air gap:

```python
Picking up tip from A1 of tip rack on 3
Aspirating 150.0 uL from A1 of well plate on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec
Air gap
        Aspirating 20.0 uL from A1 of well plate on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec
Dispensing 170.0 uL into B1 of well plate on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec
