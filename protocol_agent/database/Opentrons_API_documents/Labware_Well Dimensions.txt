The functions in the [Accessing Wells in Labware](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_labware.html#new-well-access) section above return a single [`Well`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.Well) object or a larger object representing many wells. [`Well`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.Well) objects have attributes that provide information about their physical shape, such as the depth or diameter, as specified in their corresponding labware definition. These properties can be used for different applications, such as calculating the volume of a well or a [position relative to the well](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/robot_position.html#position-relative-labware).


Depth

Use [`Well.depth`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.Well.depth) to get the distance in mm between the very top of the well and the very bottom. For example, a conical well’s depth is measured from the top center to the bottom center of the well.

```python
plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', 'D1')
depth = plate['A1'].depth  # 10.67
```


Diameter

Use [`Well.diameter`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.Well.diameter) to get the diameter of a given well in mm. Since diameter is a circular measurement, this attribute is only present on labware with circular wells. If the well is not circular, the value will be `None`. Use length and width (see below) for non-circular wells.

```python
plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', 'D1')
diameter = plate['A1'].diameter      # 6.86
```


Length

Use [`Well.length`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.Well.length) to get the length of a given well in mm. Length is defined as the distance along the robot’s x-axis (left to right). This attribute is only present on rectangular wells. If the well is not rectangular, the value will be `None`. Use diameter (see above) for circular wells.

```python
plate = protocol.load_labware('nest_12_reservoir_15ml', 'D1')
length = plate['A1'].length  # 8.2
```


Width

Use [`Well.width`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.Well.width) to get the width of a given well in mm. Width is defined as the distance along the y-axis (front to back). This attribute is only present on rectangular wells. If the well is not rectangular, the value will be `None`. Use diameter (see above) for circular wells.

```python
plate = protocol.load_labware('nest_12_reservoir_15ml', 'D1')
width = plate['A1'].width  # 71.2
```
