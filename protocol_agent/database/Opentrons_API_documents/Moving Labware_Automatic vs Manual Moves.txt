There are two ways to move labware:

- Automatically, with the Opentrons Flex Gripper.
- Manually, by pausing the protocol until a user confirms that they’ve moved the labware.

The `use_gripper` parameter of [`move_labware()`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.ProtocolContext.move_labware) determines whether a movement is automatic or manual. Set its value to `True` for an automatic move. The default value is `False`, so if you don’t specify a value, the protocol will pause for a manual move.

```python
def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    plate = protocol.load_labware('nest_96_wellplate_200ul_flat', 'D1')

    # have the gripper move the plate from D1 to D2
    protocol.move_labware(labware=plate, new_location='D2', use_gripper=True)

    # pause to move the plate manually from D2 to D3
    protocol.move_labware(labware=plate, new_location='D3', use_gripper=False)

    # pause to move the plate manually from D3 to C1
    protocol.move_labware(labware=plate, new_location='C1')
```

*New in version 2.15.*

> **Note:**
>
> Don’t add a `pause()` command before `move_labware()`. When `use_gripper` is unset or `False`, the protocol pauses when it reaches the movement step. The Opentrons App or the touchscreen on Flex shows an animation of the labware movement that you need to perform manually. The protocol only resumes when you press **Confirm and resume**.

The above example is a complete and valid `run()` function. You don’t have to load the gripper as an instrument, and there is no `InstrumentContext` for the gripper. All you have to do to specify that a protocol requires the gripper is to include at least one `move_labware()` command with `use_labware=True`.

If you attempt to use the gripper to move labware in an OT-2 protocol, the API will raise an error.
