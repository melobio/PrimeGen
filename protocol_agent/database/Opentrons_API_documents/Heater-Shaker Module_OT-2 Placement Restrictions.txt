On OT-2, you need to restrict placement of other modules and labware around the Heater-Shaker. On Flex, the module is installed below-deck in a caddy and there is more space between deck slots, so these restrictions don’t apply.

In general, it’s best to leave all slots adjacent to the Heater-Shaker empty. If your protocol requires filling those slots, observe the following restrictions to avoid physical crashes involving the Heater-Shaker.


Adjacent Modules

Do not place other modules next to the Heater-Shaker. Keeping adjacent deck slots clear helps prevents collisions during shaking and while opening the labware latch. Loading a module next to the Heater-Shaker on OT-2 will raise a `DeckConflictError`.


Tall Labware

Do not place labware taller than 53 mm to the left or right of the Heater-Shaker. This prevents the Heater-Shaker’s latch from colliding with the adjacent labware. Common labware that exceed the height limit include Opentrons tube racks and Opentrons 1000 µL tip racks. Loading tall labware to the right or left of the Heater-Shaker on OT-2 will raise a `DeckConflictError`.


8-Channel Pipettes

You can’t perform pipetting actions in any slots adjacent to the Heater-Shaker if you’re using a GEN2 or GEN1 8-channel pipette. This prevents the pipette ejector from crashing on the module housing or labware latch. Using an 8-channel pipette will raise a `PipetteMovementRestrictedByHeaterShakerError`.

There is one exception: to the front or back of the Heater-Shaker, an 8-channel pipette can access tip racks only. Attempting to pipette to non-tip-rack labware will also raise a `PipetteMovementRestrictedByHeaterShakerError`.
