Python protocols designed to run on the OT-2 canâ€™t be directly run on Flex without some modifications. This page describes the minimal steps that you need to take to get OT-2 protocols analyzing and running on Flex.

Adapting a protocol for Flex lets you have parity across different Opentrons robots in your lab, or you can extend older protocols to take advantage of new features only available on Flex. Depending on your application, you may need to do additional verification of your adapted protocol.

Examples on this page are in tabs so you can quickly move back and forth to see the differences between OT-2 and Flex code.
