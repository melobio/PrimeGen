In addition to instructing the robot where to move a pipette, you can also control the speed at which it moves. Speed controls can be applied either to all pipette motions or to movement along a particular axis.




Gantry Speed

The robot’s gantry usually moves as fast as it can given its construction. The default speed for Flex varies between 300 and 350 mm/s. The OT-2 default is 400 mm/s. However, some experiments or liquids may require slower movements. In this case, you can reduce the gantry speed for a specific pipette by setting [`InstrumentContext.default_speed`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.InstrumentContext.default_speed) like this:

```python
pipette.move_to(plate['A1'].top())  # move to the first well at default speed
pipette.default_speed = 100         # reduce pipette speed
pipette.move_to(plate['D6'].top())  # move to the last well at the slower speed
```

> **Warning:**
>
> 
>
> These default speeds were chosen because they’re the maximum speeds that Opentrons knows will work with the gantry. Your robot may be able to move faster, but you shouldn’t increase this value unless instructed by Opentrons Support.

Axis Speed Limits

In addition to controlling the overall gantry speed, you can set speed limits for each of the individual axes: `x` (gantry left/right motion), `y` (gantry forward/back motion), `z` (left pipette up/down motion), and `a` (right pipette up/down motion). Unlike `default_speed`, which is a pipette property, axis speed limits are stored in a protocol property [`ProtocolContext.max_speeds`](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_protocol_api.html#opentrons.protocol_api.ProtocolContext.max_speeds); therefore the `x` and `y` values affect all movements by both pipettes. This property works like a dictionary, where the keys are axes, assigning a value to a key sets a max speed, and deleting a key or setting it to `None` resets that axis’s limit to the default:

```python
    protocol.max_speeds['x'] = 50    # limit x-axis to 50 mm/s
    del protocol.max_speeds['x']     # reset x-axis limit
    protocol.max_speeds['a'] = 10    # limit a-axis to 10 mm/s
    protocol.max_speeds['a'] = None  # reset a-axis limit
```

Note that `max_speeds` can’t set limits for the pipette plunger axes (`b` and `c`); instead, set the flow rates or plunger speeds as described in [Pipette Flow Rates](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/pipettes/characteristics.html#new-plunger-flow-rates).
