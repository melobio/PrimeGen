2.3 First PCR Product Purification
2.3.1 Allow 30 minutes for DNA Clean Beads to warm to room temperature. Vortex and mix thoroughly before use.
2.3.2 After PCR reaction, 10 μL of each sample was pipetted into 1 PCR tube for mixing, and then 10 μL of the mixed solution was pipetted and mixed with 90 μL of TE Buffer solution (Diluted mixed solution).
2.3.3 Transfer 25 μL of diluted solution in a new PCR tube, then add 25 μL of DNA clean beads, mix well thoroughly and Incubate the mixture for 5 minutes at room temperature, then place it onto a magnetic rack for 7 min until the liquid becomes clear. Carefully aspirate the supernatant out and discard.
2.3.4 Keep the tube on Magnetic Separation Rack. Add 160 μL freshly prepared 80% ethanol to wash the beads and tube wall. Allow to stand for 30 s, then aspirate the ethanol out and discard.
2.3.5 Repeat step 2.3.4. Pipette up as much ethanol as possible. Centrifuge briefly if there is some ethanol hanging on tube wall, and then use small range pipette to pipette up all solution at the bottom of the tube after separation on rack.
2.3.6 Keep the 0.2 mL PCR tube on the Magnetic Separation Rack with the lid open. Air-dry beads at room temperature for 5 minutes.
2.3.7 Remove the tube from the rack. Add 6.5 μL TE buffer to elute DNA, please ensure the beads are fully soaked to avoid PCR product yield loss. This mixed solution was used as the 2nd PCR DNA template.
